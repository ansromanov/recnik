## üö´ Excluded Words Feature

### Overview

The excluded words feature allows users to manage words they don't want to learn, preventing them from appearing in practice sessions and lessons.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Manual Word Exclusion**

- Remove words from vocabulary using the "‚ùå Remove" button on each word card
- Words are moved to the excluded words list with reason "manual_removal"
- Excluded words won't appear in practice sessions

#### 2. **Automatic News Parser Exclusion**

- When processing news articles, unselected words are automatically excluded
- Prevents the same unwanted words from appearing in future lessons
- Marked with reason "news_parser_skip"

#### 3. **Excluded Words Management**

- View all excluded words in a collapsible table on the vocabulary page
- See exclusion reason, date, and word details
- **Restore** words back to vocabulary
- **Delete** words permanently from excluded list

#### 4. **Statistics Integration**

- Excluded words count is shown in vocabulary statistics
- Tracks manual vs automatic exclusions

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Get user's excluded words
GET /api/excluded-words

# Remove word from vocabulary and exclude it
POST /api/words/{id}/exclude

# Remove word from excluded list
DELETE /api/excluded-words/{id}

# Bulk exclude multiple words (used by news parser)
POST /api/excluded-words/bulk
```

### Database Schema

The `excluded_words` table includes:

- `user_id` - Links to the user who excluded the word
- `word_id` - Links to the excluded word
- `reason` - Why the word was excluded ("manual_removal", "news_parser_skip")
- `created_at` - When the word was excluded

### Usage Examples

#### Exclude a word manually

1. Go to vocabulary page
2. Click "‚ùå Remove" on any word
3. Confirm the action
4. Word moves to excluded list

#### Process news articles

1. Go to news page
2. Extract vocabulary from an article
3. Select only words you want to learn
4. Click "Save X Words"
5. Unselected words are automatically excluded

#### Manage excluded words

1. Go to vocabulary page
2. Click "Show" next to "Excluded Words"
3. Use "‚Ü©Ô∏è Restore" to add words back to vocabulary
4. Use "üóëÔ∏è Delete" to remove from excluded list permanently

### Benefits

- **Improved Learning Experience**: Focus only on words you want to learn
- **Reduced Clutter**: Unwanted words don't reappear in lessons
- **Flexible Management**: Easy to restore or permanently remove words
- **Automatic Filtering**: News parser respects your word preferences
- **User Isolation**: Each user has their own excluded words list
