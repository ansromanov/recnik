# User-Specific Vocabulary Changes Summary

## Overview

The vocabulary and statistics features have been updated to be user-specific. Each logged-in user now has their own personal vocabulary list, practice sessions, and progress tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### New Columns Added

- `user_vocabulary.user_id` - Links vocabulary items to specific users
- `practice_sessions.user_id` - Links practice sessions to specific users

#### New Constraints

- Unique constraint on `(user_id, word_id)` in `user_vocabulary` table
- Foreign key relationships to the `users` table
- Indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Backend API Updates

All vocabulary and practice-related endpoints now require authentication and filter data by the logged-in user:

#### Updated Endpoints (now require authentication)

- `GET /api/words` - Returns words with user-specific progress data
- `POST /api/words` - Adds words to the logged-in user's vocabulary
- `GET /api/practice/words` - Gets practice words from user's vocabulary only
- `POST /api/practice/start` - Creates practice sessions for the logged-in user
- `POST /api/practice/submit` - Updates user-specific vocabulary progress
- `POST /api/practice/complete` - Completes user's practice session
- `GET /api/stats` - Shows statistics for the logged-in user only

### 3. Model Updates

Updated SQLAlchemy models to include:

- User relationships in `User` model for vocabulary and practice sessions
- `user_id` field in `UserVocabulary` model
- `user_id` field in `PracticeSession` model
- Updated unique constraints

### 4. Frontend Integration

The frontend already includes authentication headers in all API requests through the axios interceptor, so no frontend changes were required.

## How It Works Now

1. **Vocabulary Management**:
   - When a user adds words, they are added to their personal vocabulary
   - Each user can have the same word in their vocabulary with different progress levels
   - Words in the system are shared, but vocabulary tracking is user-specific

2. **Practice Sessions**:
   - Practice words are drawn only from the user's personal vocabulary
   - Each user's practice progress is tracked independently
   - Mastery levels are maintained per user

3. **Statistics**:
   - Statistics show only the logged-in user's progress
   - Total word count shows all words in the system
   - User vocabulary count shows words in the user's personal list
   - Practice history shows only the user's sessions

## Migration Required

To enable these features, you must run the migration script:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python add_user_relationships.py
```

See [RUN_USER_MIGRATION.md](RUN_USER_MIGRATION.md) for detailed instructions.

## Benefits

1. **Privacy**: Each user's learning progress is private
2. **Personalization**: Users can focus on their own vocabulary needs
3. **Multi-user Support**: Multiple users can use the same instance
4. **Independent Progress**: Users learn at their own pace without affecting others

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing vocabulary data is preserved but won't be associated with any user
- After migration, only newly added words will be user-specific
- Consider re-adding important words to your vocabulary after logging in
