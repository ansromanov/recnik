# Settings Page Implementation Summary

## Overview

A new Settings page has been added to the Serbian Vocabulary App that allows users to configure their personal OpenAI API key for vocabulary extraction and text processing features.

## Changes Made

### Backend

The backend already had support for user-specific OpenAI API keys:

- Each user has a `Settings` table with an `openai_api_key` field
- API endpoints `/api/settings` (GET) and `/api/settings` (PUT) exist for managing settings
- All OpenAI API calls use the user-specific API key from their settings

### Frontend

#### 1. New Files Created

- `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.js` - The main Settings page component
- `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.css` - Styling for the Settings page

#### 2. Modified Files

**frontend/src/services/api.js**

- Added `getSettings()` and `updateSettings()` methods to the API service

**frontend/src/App.js**

- Added Settings page route (`/settings`)
- Added Settings navigation link in the navbar

**frontend/src/pages/NewsPage.js**

- Updated error handling to show a link to Settings page when OpenAI API key is missing
- Changed error message from plain text to JSX with a Link component

**frontend/src/pages/TextProcessorPage.js**

- Updated error handling to show a link to Settings page when OpenAI API key is missing
- Changed error message from plain text to JSX with a Link component

**frontend/src/pages/PracticePage.js**

- Updated example sentence generation to handle missing API key gracefully
- Shows a message with link to Settings page instead of example sentences when API key is not configured

## Features

### Settings Page Features

1. **API Key Configuration**
   - Secure password field for entering OpenAI API key
   - Show/Hide toggle for viewing the API key
   - Clear instructions and link to OpenAI platform

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Success message when settings are saved
   - Error messages for failures
   - Loading states during save operations

3. **Information Section**
   - Explains what the API key is used for
   - Lists all features that require the API key

### User Experience Improvements

1. When users try to use features requiring OpenAI API without a configured key, they see:
   - A clear error message
   - A direct link to the Settings page
   - Context-appropriate styling (error colors for News/Text Processing, warning colors for Practice mode)

2. The Settings page is accessible from:
   - The main navigation bar
   - Error messages in other pages when API key is needed

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Without API Key:**
   - Go to News page, select an article, click "Extract Vocabulary"
   - Go to Process Text page, enter text and click "Process Text"
   - Go to Practice page, answer correctly to see example sentence prompt
   - All should show messages with links to Settings

2. **With API Key:**
   - Go to Settings page
   - Enter your OpenAI API key
   - Click "Save Settings"
   - Try the features again - they should work normally

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in the database per user
- Keys are only visible to the user who owns them
- Keys are transmitted over HTTPS in production
- Backend validates API key ownership before use
